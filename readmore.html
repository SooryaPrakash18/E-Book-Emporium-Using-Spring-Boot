        <h1>Effective Book Notes</h1>
        <p>Because the formal education system focuses on rote learning, the way we’re taught to read in school was more for the purpose of writing book reports or for letter grades than it was for a genuine love for reading or learning.</p>
        <p>Chances are you don’t remember much from most books you read in high school. This is what I remember from some of the great American novels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Holden Caufield was angry</span> (<em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>)</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Jay Gatsby was rich</span> (<em>The Great Gatsby</em>)</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Holy shit this is boring</span> (<em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given that these books have remained relevant decades after they were written, it’s likely that they contain valuable insights and wisdom. Because of how we learn to take effective notes on the books we read, we rarely remember much that’s of any value.</p>
        <p>If you want to take more effective notes on the books you read, you need a process that lets you identify key concepts, filter out what’s relevant, capture what resonates, and apply it to your life.</p>
        
        <h2>Physical Books vs Digital Books</h2>
        <div class="note-section">
            <h3>Physical Books: Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>Physical books have several advantages over digital books.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They’re distraction-free by default. On an iPad or digital device, there are a thousand other things competing for your attention.</li>
                <li>When you read physical books, you retain more.</li>
                <li>It’s easier to be discerning about what you capture.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As somebody who reads a lot of books, I’ve found two main disadvantages to physical books.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They take up a lot of space. Managing shelf space is an ongoing challenge for me.</li>
                <li>Converting the ideas that resonate with you into a digital format can be tedious and time-consuming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But the most successful writers I’ve ever spoken to all swear by physical books. So I think the trade-off is worth it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="note-section">
            <h3>Digital Books: Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>There are two big advantages to digital books:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They don’t take up much space.</li>
                <li>Converting the ideas that you resonate with into a digital format is much faster because you can easily export everything you capture.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After years of reading digital books, I found two major disadvantages to them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Because you’re reading on a device, it’s easy to get distracted (especially if you’re using an iPad with a bunch of other apps on it).</li>
                <li>You scan more than you read and because of this, you don’t retain as much.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is a matter of personal preference. But I noticed that I got far more from a book when I read a physical copy vs when I read the digital version.</p>

        <h2>Identifying The Structure And Key Concepts In The Book</h2>
        <div class="note-section">
            <p>Every book you read has one overarching concept. You want to understand what the book is about and why the author wrote it. If that’s not obvious from the title, read the back of the book or the flap. The table of contents will also help you to determine the structure of the book.</p>
            <p>Even though I read the books of every person I interview, there are occasions when I don’t have time to transcribe my notes. In those cases, I create a mindmap from the table of contents and the subheadings of each chapter. You can use the same technique to identify the key concepts and the structure of the book.</p>

        <h2>Analog Methods for Taking More Effective Book Notes</h2>
        <div class="note-section note-methods">
            <p>Keeping a notebook by your side will not only help you take more effective notes on the books you read, but it will also help you to capture insights and ideas that you may not remember later. And if you’re struggling to keep your notebook organized, I recommend using The Bullet Journal Method.</p>
            <p>Ryan Holiday learned about the notecard system from his mentor Robert Greene. After you finish reading a book do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wait for a couple of days or weeks. Ryan suggests doing this because we often underline or capture things at the moment that are not relevant or resonant when we revisit them.</li>
                <li>Write down quotes and highlights on a notecard and store them in a file or box, categorized by topic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While this is often time-consuming, Ryan’s results speak for themselves. He wrote down the idea for The Obstacle is the Way several years before he wrote the book. Today it’s sold over a million copies. As Ryan said to me, “Many of them (the notecards) lead to nothing, but you can build a career from one of them.”</p>

        <h2>Progressive Summarization: A Digital Method For Taking Book Notes</h2>
        <div class="note-section digital-tools">
            <p>With a Kindle book, it’s easy and effortless to highlight as many passages as you want and export everything to a digital tool like Notion or Evernote. But that doesn’t make your book notes very useful or effective.</p>
            <p>Tiago Forte developed a method to take more effective notes on books called Progressive Summar</p>
