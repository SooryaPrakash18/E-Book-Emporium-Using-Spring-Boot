# E-Book-Emporium Using-Spring-Boot
This is my final year mini project in MCA. This project is helpful for learners.
The E-book Emporium is a comprehensive digital marketplace designed to streamline the process of buying and selling e-books. Utilizing Spring Boot, MySQL, HTML/CSS/JS, and Bootstrap, the platform offers a seamless user experience. Users can easily sign up and log in to access a wide range of e-books. Advanced search capabilities allow users to find books based on their preferences quickly. The cart feature supports multiple payment options, including Google Pay, credit/debit cards, and cash on delivery, providing flexibility and convenience. For administrators, the platform offers an intuitive interface to monitor the number of users, books sold, and books added, facilitating effective management. Sellers can effortlessly add new books and manage their inventory through a dedicated seller page. Customers benefit from a streamlined product view and purchase process, enhancing their overall experience.
